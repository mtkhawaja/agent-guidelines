# Junie Guidelines

According to the [JetBrains documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/junie/customize-guidelines.html):

> By default, Junie looks for agent guidelines at .junie/guidelines.md in the root folder of the configured project. If
> you want to use an AGENTS.md file, or a guidelines.md file at a custom file path, set Guidelines path
> in [Settings | Tools | Junie | Project Settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/junie/project-settings.html).

We use [AGENTS.md](./.junie/AGENTS.md) instead to align with more widely adopted naming conventions. This file serves as
a baseline set of agent guidelines that can be copied and adapted on a per-project basis. It is intended to provide a
solid starting point rather than a one-size-fits-all configuration. You should add your own project specific guidelines
to this file (e.g., build commands etc.)
